# AlignmentAlgorithms

[*generalized ADPfusion Homepage*](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/gADP/)

A selection of (sequence) alignment algorithms. Both terminal, and syntactic
variables, as well as the index type is not fixed here. This makes it possible
to select the correct structure of the grammar here, but bind the required data
type for alignment in user code.
